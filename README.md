suggestion list
faking the login/sign in button
	chanage the sign in button so it react differently when user "logged in", best bet is to look into js
	( Patrik can do that )
the order in order list dont look clickable, maybe make a button
  ( We should style this then to look like a button, or at least behave more like a button with a hover state etc.)
	current in my account there is a list of ordered item, for some visual reason most people dont think it's clickable, and they are looking for a button
	( Look above, we can style it to behave more like a button, start with making it into a self contained div that has a hover state, maybe a border that looks similar to our other buttons)
bottom of landing page used a 3colum and 4colum grid and somewhat confusing
	it could be the issus with not having content in it
	( I'll look into that, it could be no content and it could also just be that it is two different grids with no seperation )
and landing page need to have more things, it's too empty, maybe put products there
	people want to see some example products for the website.
	( Hmm ok for the products on the front page we can use example pillows, that then lead to an order page )
there is currently no link to get to all product
	( Do we want one on the navigation bar? Or just have it as a button by the product examples on the front page? Either works I think. )
