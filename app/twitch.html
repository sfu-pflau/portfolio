        Reccomended Tab Feature
      </h2>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        Twitch has updated their mobile app to include many changes including changes that target some of the needs of this project.

        See these changes Twitch has done to their app here: <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/new-twitch-mobile-app-available-now-aa527264091b">Twitch Mobile App Update Annoucement</a>.

        My Roles
      </h3>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        I helped with the research of possible design gaps with Twitch's mobile app and it's feature parity with their desktop site. I also helped design the overall user flow to the feature designed, creating wireframes and mockups, and the presentation deck.
      </p>
      <h3 class="fixedsize centered center-block-subtitle">
        Research
      </h3>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        With my partner, we identified in that version of Twitch’s mobile app lacked the ability of the desktop site to onboard brand new viewers to the Twitch viewing experience through a set of curated broadcasters. The feature we proposed for the Twitch was to have a Recommended viewing experience that would mimic the benefits of the landing page of the desktop site but redesign in layout for the mobile platform.

        These are the three users we quickly evalutated for preliminary research.
      </p>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        This feature’s design began from preliminary research with potential users conducted on campus. From this small subset we identified a gap in user's not finding exactly what they want or finding what they want as a consequence of the current design not as part of an intent.
      </p>
      <h3 class="fixedsize centered center-block-subtitle">
        Proposed Design
      </h3>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        Our proposed design was to create a curated channel feed and featured broadcaster section to help users find new content and let see what's popular on Twitch's platform. Users can make use of this section by entering it and browsing whats inside and entering a featured broadcaster’s channel. When entering the Twitch App they can enter at a point that sets themselves up for a quick entry to a broadcaster channel they should have more enjoyment viewing.
      </p>
      <div class="img-container centered clearfix">
        <img class="col-12" src="img/twitch_entry.png" alt="twitch splash" />
      </div>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        By creating a “Recommended” page we want surface content that would have more meaningful information to new users. Current presentation is visually dense screens with little contextual information and content based purely on number of viewers.
      </p>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        This will allow new or amatuer users to better browse for popular content and choose a stream they wish to watch based on the information provided by the recommendations.
      </p>
      <h3 class="fixedsize centered center-block-subtitle">
        Design Decisions
      </h3>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        The main decisions made in terms of interface design was in ensuring maintaining the branding and style that Twitch has used in the rest of the application, as well as finding the ideal entry point for users to enter the Recommended tab from.
      </p>

        <img class="col-12" src="img/twitch_6.png" alt="twitch splash" />
      </div>
      <p class="fixedsize centered">
        The presentation of a recomended stream presents the information necessary for a new viewer to get what the stream is about, and possible reasons to watch. The possible reasons include the description, view count, follow count, and concurrent viewers.
